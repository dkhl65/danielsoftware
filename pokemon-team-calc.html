			<p>
				In the Pokemon column, select the types of the Pokemon in your party and their abilities if they affect type matchups.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the Attacks column, select the types of damaging moves that your Pokemon have. Freeze-Dry and Thousand Arrows are unique attacks with special type matchups.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Ineffective Coverage column shows the type combinations that resist or are immnune to all your Pokemon's attacks.
				If single type symbols are shown, it means that the Pokemon cannot do neutral or better damage to that type and combinations of those types.
				For example, if your Pokemon only knows Dark attacks, Fighting, Dark and Fairy symbols are shown, but it is also not very effective against Fighting-Dark, Water-Dark, etc.
				Specific type combination symbols may be shown, which look like half of each type symbol together.
				For example, if you Pokemon knows Electric and Ice attacks, it will be fine against Electric opponents and Steel opponents, but is not very effective against Electric-Steel opponents.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Weaknesses column show the types that do super effective damage on your Pokemon.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Resistances and Immunities column show types that are not very effective or do not affect your Pokemon. "Im" stands for "Immune". 
				In the total row, if you team has immunities, the number of resistances and immunites are shown in the format of "number of resistances + number of immunities".
