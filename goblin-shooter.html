					<h2>Goblin Shooter</h2>
					<img src="images/GoblinShooterMenu.png"/>
					<p>This is a simple 2D platforming and shooting game created using Python with the Pygame library. The player character is moved using WSAD or arrow keys on the keyboard. 
					W or up arrow is for jumping, 
					S or down arrow is for passing down through platforms. Bullets are fired using the space bar or Enter key
					The enemies are goblins. They walk back and forth between their range and randomly change directions, jump and pass down through platforms.
					Contact with goblins will damage the player. Goblins are eliminated after they are shot four times. 1 second of invincibility is given to the player after losing HP or when a goblin spawns.</p>
					<br/>
					<h3>Survival</h3>

					<p>In Survival mode, the player will die after one contact with a goblin. Each shot that hits a goblin scores 1 point. The spawn rate of the goblins increases depending on the score,
					with a maximum rate of a spawn every 2 seconds at 60 points. There will be 6 or fewer goblins on the screen at a time. Kill as many goblins as possible until </p>
					<br/>
					<h3>Swarm</h3>
					<img src="images/GoblinShooterSwarm.png"/>
					<p>In Swarm mode, each contact with a goblin deals 10 damage to the player. Goblins spawn every 3 seconds, with a limit of 6 goblins on the screen at once. Defeat 50 goblins to win.
					A timer keeps track of how long you took to finish.</p>
					<br/>
					<h3>Adventure</h3>

					<p>The Adventure mode is a side scrolling platformer. The player needs to navigate the level, collect all gold pieces and kill all goblins before reaching a wooden sign post to win. 
					Goblins drop a gold piece when they die. There is a timer to keep track of how long you took to finish the level. Each contact with a goblin deals 15 damage. 
					Falling off the screen will instantly kill the player.</p>
					<br/>
					<h3>Platforms</h3>
					<img src="images/GoblinShooterPlatforms.png"/>
					<p>On the top left of the image is a platform. You can jump from underneath it. You can also pass down through the platform by pressing down arrow or S while standing or walking.
					On the bottom right is a cliff. You can walk through the brown area and jump up from underneath onto the green surface, but you cannot pass down through it.</p>
